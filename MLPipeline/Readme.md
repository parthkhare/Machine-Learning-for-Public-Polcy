# Assignment II: Machine Learning Pipeline
[Jupyter Notebook](https://github.com/parthkhare/Machine-Learning-for-Public-Polcy/blob/master/MLPipeline/ML_Pipeline_HW2.ipynb)

### Repository Structure
- data: contains data used in the model 
- charts: contains visualisation of a sample tree 

### Dependencies
+ Dataset: Modified version of Kaggle [GiveMeSomeCredit] (https://www.kaggle.com/c/GiveMeSomeCredit)
+ Primary libaries: sklearn, graphviz
+ Helper function: modules to wrap data exploration, pre-processing for expeditous model building

### Broad Assumptions
+ Model results & Summary (on feature understanding) considered in statistical context.
  - open to correction/improvemnt with learning more about the working of the model
+ Comparison with linear regression would help in showing marginal difference in model performance
+ Current form of model does not include working with hyperparameters and tree pruning, CV
 - further work can be done to control for possible overfitting
